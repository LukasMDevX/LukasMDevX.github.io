  <!-- Description -->
  <p>
    This project was developed as part of a six-month internship at TU Darmstadt.
    The goal was to replace conventional IT security trainings with an interactive
    3D serious game that teaches security-relevant topics in a practical and engaging way.

    Players take on the role of an IT security officer navigating a virtual office
    environment, responding to incidents, identifying security risks, and supporting
    colleagues throughout a simulated workday.

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>
    This project was developed as part of my master’s thesis.
    The goal was to create a Godot editor plugin that enables designers to generate
    game worlds without requiring technical knowledge of math, linear algebra,
    or engine-specific workflows.

    Instead of manually placing objects or configuring complex generation parameters,
    designers can describe spatial relationships using semantic annotations such as
    “four chairs next to a table”. The system then generates a corresponding scene
    based on a graph-defined structure.
  </p>

  <!-- Key Features -->
  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Custom Godot editor plugin with a dedicated dock UI</li>
    <li>Graph-based world generation workflow</li>
    <li>Semantic annotations for high-level spatial descriptions</li>
    <li>Automatic scene generation from designer-friendly inputs</li>
    <li>Decoupling of design intent from technical implementation</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- Your Contribution -->
  <h3>My Contribution</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Concept, design, and full implementation of the editor plugin</li>
    <li>Development of a custom graph editor for defining generation logic</li>
    <li>Implementation of semantic interpretation and scene generation</li>
    <li>Integration into the Godot editor workflow</li>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>
    A top-down zombie shooter prototype developed in Godot, with a strong focus on
    modular gameplay systems rather than visual fidelity.
    The project explores quest-driven progression, reusable combat and AI logic,
    and persistent unlocks across play sessions.
    This is a personal project im currently working on and is still work in progress.
    Some system may change, expand or will be replaced in the future.

  <h2>Ever After - Soulslike Gameplay Prototype (Godot)</h2>

  <p class="project-subtitle">
    Systems-Driven Gameplay Prototype with focus on third person controller and enemy attack decision logic.

  </div>

  <!-- Description -->
  <p>
    Ever After is a personal Soulslike-style gameplay prototype developed to explore combat systems and enemy decision-making in a third-person action game.
    The project features a custom third-person controller with lock-on targeting, dodge mechanics, and an invincibility-frame system designed for responsive and deliberate combat.
    The player combat system includes a weapon-based attack chain supported by an input buffering system, allowing attacks and dodges to be queued without frame-perfect timing.
    Enemy behavior is driven by a modular decision system that selects attacks based on explicit conditions such as player distance and awareness range.
    The prototype consists of a single handcrafted level featuring three distinct enemy types and a boss encounter, each built on the same underlying AI system.
    The focus of the project is on clean system design, debuggability, and extensibility rather than content scale or presentation.
  </p>

  <!-- Key Features -->
  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Custom third-person character controller with lock-on targeting</li>
    <li>Dodge mechanic with invincibility frames (i-frames)</li>
    <li>Weapon-based player attack chains (combo system)</li>
    <li>Input buffering for both attacks and dodge actions</li>
    <li>Modular enemy attack decision system based on conditions and priorities</li>
    <li>Three enemy archetypes and one boss built on shared systems</li>
    <li>Single-level prototype focused on gameplay and system validation</li>
  </ul>
